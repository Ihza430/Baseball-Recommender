Capstone Progress Report

1. The dataset I have been using was from the Lahmen Database only has the stats for a player for the year. After Having talked to Eric about my project. I decided it would be better to get the stats of a player for each game to create a SARIMAX model. The data I will now be using is from retrosheet which has the stats of player by game.

2. Since I will be using a new dataset, I have to redo my EDA. But what I have found from my previous EDA with my original dataset is that many of the stats are correlated with each other and they all have a right skew. 

3. I did start doing various regression models on my original dataset which all the models have done pretty well with each model having at least an r2 score of 85.

4. I haven't experienced any blockers yet but I will probably expecting it when doing my SARIMAX models just because I know I had trouble with those during my lab. 

5. I have not changed my topic since the last checkin. But depending how far I get this week I might forgo adding the salary aspect of my recommender system.

6. I want to get my data cleaning, EDA, and my models done for sure and maybe start thinking of a design for my app.

7. I think I really want to talk about my thought process on how I am going to achieve this recommender system. I just want to make sure the tools/models/techniques I want to use are actually the tools/models/techniques that can achieve what I want to do.
